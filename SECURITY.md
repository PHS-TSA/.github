# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

<!-- Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates. -->

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 2022-2023 | :white_check_mark: |

Currently, we update all projects for the current school year.
Old, unmaintained projects will not be updated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

 <!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
-->

Send vulnerability reports via the Advisories tab on the Security page.
Generally, Dependabot or CodeQL will have already warned us, but it never hurts.
